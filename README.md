# Diffusion Tutorials and Examples

This project contains example code that demonstrates the use of the [Diffusion](https://www.pushtechnology.com/product-overview) and [Diffusion SDKs](https://docs.pushtechnology.com/#sdks).

Here, you will find complete code examples on a variety of programing languages (Javascript for now) to build applications in the following categories:

* [Real-Time Messaging](https://github.com/pushtechnology/tutorials/tree/master/messaging)
* Real-time Data Store with Kafka
* Real-time Apps (Web, Mobile, IoT)

# Setup
 All our examples include a README file describing the diferent features we will use from our SDK.
